# Flatpaks
Random stuff that I packaged as Flatpaks.

# Building & Installing Flatpaks
Just move into the directory of the Flatpak you want to install, and run `flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir <filename>.yml`

If an application needs some extra work before being able to install/build it, it will have a README in it describing the process in more detail.
